# SL Comp-IA: The Power of Circuitry, Margaret Cole, Period: 4B 
This repository is dedicated to my standard level (SL) computer science internal assessment (IA) for the international baccalaureate program. The Computer Science Internal Assessment (IA) is officially called 'The Solution.' It involves using Computing technology to solve a problem for a real-life client. The IA accounts for 30% of the total Standard Level (SL) grade and 20% of the Higher Level (HL) grade. Learn more here --> https://ib.compscihub.net/internal 
# "The Scenario" (Criterion A)
The client is my physics teacher, Mr.Lambert, who has been struggling to find an adequate online circuit simulator for his beginner physics class. Many of the builders he finds online are missing key aspects, such as an indicator for voltage level. After consulting with him, I suggested that we create a simulation that is equipped with personalized visuals he can choose. 
# "The Rationale" (Criterion A)
Outline: Why Java is ideal for creating a circuit builder simulation  
1. Platform independence (Cross-platform capability)  
Using Java would make it easier to reach a broader range of users on any platform (Windows, macOS, Linux) without modification.
2. Object-Oriented Design (OOP)
Javas modular structure allows for the creation of reusable components (Resistors, capacitors, wires, etc.) this also allows for new features to be added without disrupting the core structure.

# SL Comp-IA: The Power of Circuitry, Margaret Cole, Period: 4B 
This repository is dedicated to my standard level (SL) computer science internal assessment (IA) for the international baccalaureate program. The Computer Science Internal Assessment (IA) is officially called 'The Solution.' It involves using Computing technology to solve a problem for a real-life client. The IA accounts for 30% of the total Standard Level (SL) grade and 20% of the Higher Level (HL) grade. Learn more here --> https://ib.compscihub.net/internal 
# "The Scenario" (Criterion A)
The client is my physics teacher, Mr.Lambert, who has been struggling to find an adequate online circuit simulator for his beginner physics class. Many of the builders he finds online are missing key aspects, such as voltage level indicators. After consulting with him, I suggested we create a simulation equipped with personalized visuals/ features he can choose from. 
# "The Rationale" (Criterion A)
Outline: Why Java is ideal for creating a circuit builder simulation  
1. Platform independence (Cross-platform capability):   
Java would make it easier to reach a broader range of users on any platform (Windows, macOS, Linux) without modification.
3. Object-Oriented Design (OOP):   
Java's modular structure allows for the creation of reusable components (Resistors, capacitors, wires, etc.), and new features can be added without disrupting the core structure.
3. Concurrency and Multithreading:
In a circuit-building program, simulations require complex and often computationally intensive calculations. Java’s built-in support for multithreading and concurrency handles these things more efficiently, improving the program’s performance and responsiveness.
4. Optimization: While Java isn’t as low-level as C or C++, it is still highly optimized through the Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler and garbage collection.
